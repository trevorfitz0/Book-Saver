<h1 align=center>Book Saver</h1>

## Abstract
Book Saver is an application that pulls the data from the NYT Best Sellers Lists, and allows the user to view them. There's a homepage that starts with a popular section that displays 4 of the current #1 books, and then a bunch of filters the user can click through to view the current books on all the non-deprecated NYT Bestsellers Lists. When a user clicks on a book, they'll be brought to a new page displaying more info about the book, and give a couple of buttons for the user to have quick access to sites they can purchase the book from. There's also a login page and an account registration page that allows a user to connect their google account or create a new account on the app, all authenticated through Google Firebase.

## Project Viewing
Unfortunately, since the app uses Secret API Keys through Google Firebase, it's unable to be pulled down and run locally. However, it's fully usable [here](https://trevorfitz0.github.io/Book-Saver)

## Learning Goals
- Pick up a new technology outside the scope of the Turing Program and implement it into a project.
- Solidify our understanding of React fundamentals.
- Create a multi-page UX utilizing React Router.

## Wins + Challenges
- A win came in the form of Firebase implementation - the docs were easy to understand and the installation process was much simpler than expected.
- A challenge came in the form of Testing - Cypress performs inconsistently at best - tests will fail, then pass upon refresh. It was a challenge to know when our test was actually correct vs. when they were written wrong.
